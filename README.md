## About LMS

This is a Learning Management System (LMS) created using Laravel 9 , jquery and mysql as the database. You can use a lot of helpful features provided by this system. Also, this system includes a responsive design that works with mobile devices. The system comprises three different categories of users: administrators, teachers, and students. The admin is in charge of keeping track of crucial information including the list of subjects, classes, departments, and so on. These days, when some classes are offered through modular distance learning, this system may also be helpful. Using this method, faculty members or teachers can prepare practice exams and assignments for classes as well as give students digital copies of learning materials. Within the time frame set by the teacher, students can respond to the practice questions.
